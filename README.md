##🏡 House Price Prediction – README
📌 Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various property features.
The workflow includes:

• Data loading & cleaning

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

• Feature engineering

• Model training & evaluation

• Final prediction results

• This notebook is ideal for learning how regression models work on real-world datasets.

🔧 Technologies Used

• Python 3

• NumPy

• Pandas

• Matplotlib

• Seaborn

• Scikit-learn

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains features commonly associated with home value predictions, such as:

Number of bedrooms

Number of bathrooms

Living area (sqft)

Lot size

Floors

Waterfront

View and condition

Year built / renovated

House price (target)

(Your actual dataset may have additional or fewer columns.)

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Steps included in the notebook:

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling (if needed)

Feature selection using correlation analysis

🤖 Machine Learning Models

The notebook applies and evaluates several regression models, including:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost (optional)

Each model is evaluated using metrics such as:

Linera Rigression MAE was 0.1874168384159986
